# Downstream Mapping Test

The aim for this project is to get a better understanding of how a code change impacts downstream dependencies. The aim is to construct a graph of where a particular function is called and where that function is called from and so on.

## Getting Started

### Install some dependencies

tree-sitter tree-sitter-python

### Run the test implementation

`python rnd/codebase-mapping/downstream/test.py`
